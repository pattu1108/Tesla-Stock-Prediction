Tesla Stock Price Prediction
Predicting Tesla’s stock price trends using historical data and machine learning techniques.
Overview
This project explores Tesla's stock price data and builds a machine learning model to predict its closing prices. It includes data preprocessing, 
feature engineering, visualizations, and model evaluation, achieving impressive predictive accuracy. The project demonstrates the potential of data-driven forecasting in financial markets
Data Collection: Historical Tesla stock data retrieved using .
Feature Engineering: Created meaningful predictors like moving averages, RSI, and lagged prices.
Model Development: Leveraged  for robust predictions.
Evaluation: Achieved excellent metrics with RMSE of 9.48 and R² of 0.99.
Visualization: Compared actual and predicted stock prices to assess performance.
